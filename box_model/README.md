The CSS Box Model
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

### Hints

Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

Instructions:-
Step 1- Add a heading at the top.

        • Add 50px padding,
        • 20px margin,
