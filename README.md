# CSS Exercises

These exercises are designed to complement the HTML and CSS lessons from The Odin Project (TOP). They should only be completed when instructed during the course of the curriculum.

When doing these exercises, feel free to use any documentation or resources necessary to complete them. At this stage, you're not expected to have everything memorized. Check the docs, use Google, and do what you need to do (except checking the solutions) to get them done.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We encourage you to practice using Git by committing and pushing your changes to your own fork of the repository. However, please **DO NOT** open a Pull Request to have your solutions merged into this repo. If we merge your changes, the exercises would no longer be available as intended for new learners, and it adds unnecessary work for us to close such PRs.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions to improve an exercise, ideas for new exercises, or notice any issues, feel free to open an issue after reading our [contributing guide](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How To Use These Exercises

1. **Fork and clone this repository**: To learn how to fork a repository, refer to the GitHub documentation on how to [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
    - If you need help cloning a repository to your local environment, you can follow GitHub's [cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) guide.
2. Navigate to an exercise directory and open the HTML file in your web browser.
    - You can open it directly or use tools like VSCode’s Live Server extension.
3. For each exercise, thoroughly read the README before starting.
    - Each README contains a "Self Check" list. Use this to ensure you haven't missed any important details in your implementation.
4. Make your changes in the `index.html` and/or `style.css` files to match the Desired Outcome image(s).
    - Depending on the instructions, you might only need to modify one file.
5. After completing an exercise, check TOP's solution to compare it with your own.
    - Do not check the solution until you have finished the exercise!
    - If your approach is different but still meets the requirements, that’s perfectly fine. Feel free to ask for clarification on our Discord if something is unclear.

> Please do not submit your solutions to this repository. Any PRs that include solutions will be closed without merging.

## Some Hints

- Official solutions often add changes to the _end_ of the CSS file, which may result in duplicate selectors (e.g., two `body {}` selectors). While working on the exercise, it's better practice to add your styles to existing selectors rather than duplicating them.
- Unless specified in the self-check section, don't stress over getting the exact pixel value for margins, padding, or font sizes. These exercises are meant to test your understanding of CSS, not your ability to guess precise measurements.
- You may need to add elements to your HTML to achieve the correct layout.
- You might also need to add more selectors to your CSS file. In early exercises, most of the CSS is already written, but as you progress, you’ll be adding more to meet the requirements.
