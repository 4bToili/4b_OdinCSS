## Getting Started

To implement this animation effect on your own links, follow these clear instructions:

### Step 1: Add Pseudo-Elements

You need to add pseudo-elements (::before or ::after) to the link elements to create the underline effect. These pseudo-elements will be used to style the underline.

### Step 2: Use position: relative

Apply the CSS property position: relative to the link elements. This is important to ensure that the underline spans the entire width of the link.

### Step 3: Customize as Desired

You can customize the animation further by adjusting the CSS properties for the pseudo-elements, such as width, height, background-color, and transition for the smooth animation effect. Experiment with these properties to achieve the desired visual result.
