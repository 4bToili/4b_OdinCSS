# Preloader

In this exercise we have set up a simple preloader.

we've just written a little @keyframes to 'scale' the div's and given blur effect.

### Hints
- "Preloader" is another word for 'Loading Animation'
- The all Square Div's ('yellow','red','blue','green') must animate one after the other   with delay of 0.1 seconds each, with scaling and blur property.
- First Square Div Animate Without delay (Instantly When you open the Page).
- Don't Think this is complicated, it's just require some lines of extra code.

## Desired Outcome
