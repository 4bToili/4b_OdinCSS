# CSS WAVES

In this exercise we'll understand how the wave effects work in css.

Do not do this like me using svg (until you are not clear with svgs).

Step 1: You've to create 3 or 4 divs(according to the layers of waves you want).
Step 2: Use the png image povided below for making waves and use them as a background image of the divs you've created.
Step 3: To make them move from left to right use animation property and set the duration followed by linear infinite to keep them moving continously.

### Self Check
- The waves delay and keep moving in the motion according to your setup?
- Make sure that the Background color of body is not white.
